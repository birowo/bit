People are re-inventing and duplicating code components already written before on daily basis.\nThis wastes precious time and effort which can be better invested in building new things. Components can be improved and evolved without having to start from scratch every time. Duplicating components across repositories isn't any better, as maintaining or changing a single function becomes an odyssey, and the larger the code base the worse it gets.\nUp until Bit, the only way to make components reusable was to spend too much time on boilerplating and build configuration just to end up having to maintain a git repository, a package and CI for every small component. This isn’t practical and is very hard to scale.\nTo understand the solution we turned back to the basics of writing code, as we were taught from day one. We should create independent and isolated components. We should also manage them to make this a practical practice.\nTo achieve this we designed Bit - the first code component manager. Bit is a distributed manager written in JavaScript yet designed to be language agnostic. It allows you to make components reusable with zero initial configuration and use these components across repositories. It also helps to store, organize and manage your components. It allows you to group your components by context, while also handling versioning, dependency management, build and test execution and more. Bit also makes components easy to find and collaborate on.\nAt the end of the day, distributed component management is deeply connected to the very basics of writing software as we want it to be. Managing code components can help us all to build great things out of smaller building blocks - together. Imagine the possibilities.\n"},"installation.html":{"url":"installation.html","title":"Installing Bit","keywords":"","body":"Installation\nUsing NPM\nIf you have NPM installed, you can use it to install Bit: (recommended)\nnpm install bit-bin --global\nUsing brew (macOS)\nHomebrew - Bit can be installed via Homebrew package manager:\nbrew install bit\nDebian/Ubuntu Linux\nOn Debian or Ubuntu Linux, you can install Bit via our Debian package repository.

Local scopes are created for your projects. Components exported to remote scopes can be used across projects. It's recommended to create the scope at the root of a project.\nType the following in the command line.\n\nmkdir hello-world Create an empty directory.\n\ncd hello-world\n\nbit init Initialize an empty scope.\n\n\nThis generates a bit.json file and a .bit directory.\nYou can read more about the local scope here.\nCreate a Bit component\nBit components are organized and managed in scopes. To create your first Bit component go to a project with a bit scope in it (or create one by using bit init in a directory).\n1. Create a Bit component:\nbit create is-string\nThis creates an implementation file in the inline_components directory.\n\nBit components contain a minimum of one impl.js file and may contain two additional files: spec.js and bit.json - component.\n\n2. Write the component's implementation in the impl.js file created for the component.\nopen ./inline_components/global/is-string/impl.js\nYou can copy and paste this example:\n  module.exports = function isString(val) {\n    return typeof val === 'string';\n  };\n\n\nYou can see the status of all the components in your project using: bit status.\n\nA component-id is built from / but you can refer to a component without the namespace if it's in the global namespace.\n\n\nUse the Bit component in your code\n3. Install the bit-js module using NPM or Yarn.\nnpm install bit-js\n4. Create a file - touch index.js && open index.js, require bit-js module, and call the component:\nconst bit = require('bit-js');\nconst isString = bit('is-string'); // \n\nconsole.log(isString('It\\'s the bit')); // true\nconsole.log(isString(1)); // false\n\n5. Now run the application node index.js.\nbit-js will resolve the component from the inline_components directory.\n\nRead more about Drivers.\n\nCommit your code\nOur goal is to use a component in our future work. Before exporting it to a remote scope, it needs to be committed from your inline_components to your local scope.\n6. bit commit is-string 'initial commit'\n\nYour component moved from the inline_components directory into the components directory. You can still use it with bit-js driver, the same way as before.\n\nYou can view the component you just added to your scope: bit show @this/is-string\n\nWhen you perform a commit, Bit creates an immutable object with your identify as the Author, you can verify it with the following command - bit log @this/is-string. If you don't see your identity please configure you identity\n\nUse bit status to get a clear view of all components in your local scope.\n\n\nSummary\n\nmkdir  && cd \nbit init\nbit create \nopen ./inline_components//impl.js // write some code in impl.js\nbit commit  'initial commit'\nSetup a Remote Scope\nCreate and use as many remote scopes as you need to distribute your code, to be later reused across projects and development teams.\nCreate a remote scope\nYou can host a scope on any POSIX machine (you can host multiple scopes on the same machine/VM). All remote communication is done over SSH.\nFollow these steps to host your own scope:\n\nVerify that bit is installed.\n\nCreate a directory on your machine. mkdir scopy && cd scopy\n\nInitialize a bare Bit scope in the new folder. bit init --bare\n\n\nThat's it, the scope is ready, next we need to register it as a remote scope.\nAdd the new scope to your remotes list\nIf you are in the scope directory use pwd and copy the current working directory to the clipboard.\nWe will refer to it as \nIn your own development machine, use the remote command to add the new remote scope to your project.\nbit remote add file:// --global\nYou can check your registered remotes with the bit remote command.s\n\n\nYou can also add a scope from another machine via ssh.\n\nbit remote add ssh://user@server --global\n\nImportant note about ssh!\n\nssh://user@server === /path/to.scope\nssh:///path/to/scope> === /path/to.scope\n\nIf you don't use the --global flag, the remote is added to a specific project.\n\nbit remote add ssh://user@server\nExport a component\nExporting your components to a remote scope enables reusability. It allows you and others to import them from a different repositories and modify them when needed.\nImportant -  If you don't have a remote scope yet, please create one on Setup a remote scope\nGo back to the 'Hello-world' directory, where you first created your component and committed it. Now Export the component to the remote scope using bit export @this/is-string @scopy\n\nassuming that you created @scopy in the initial setup chapter\n\nYour component exported from the local scope, but it is still in the components directory, and available for requiring in the project. it also adds it to the bit.json file as a dependency.\n\nyou can use bit list @scopy and bit show @scopy/is-string to verify that your component exported correctly.\n\n\nsummary\n\nbit export @this/ \nImport a component\nOpen a new directory somewhere else.\nmkdir different-project && cd different-project\nCreate a new scope\nbit init\nimport the component and save it in bit.json file.\nbit import @scopy/is-string --save\nYou can see that the component was exported to the project. (located in the components directory)\nSummary\n\nmkdir  && cd \nbit init\nbit import / --save\nModify a component\nFirst, a few notes about versioning - Bit doesn’t use semantic versioning. Instead, it supports only incremented component versioning. For example, the first version of a component will be 1, the second will be 2 and so forth.\nLet's say we want to add documentation to the component we've just created.\n1. Import the component to the inline_bits folder:\nbit modify @scopy/is-string\nThe component is also in the staging area as you can see by typing bit status.\nWhen you'll commit it, the version will increment itself.\n2. Open the impl.js file and make some changes. you can also copy and paste the following code.\nopen ./inline_components/global/is-string/impl.js\n\n  \n  /**\n  * determines whether `val` is a string.\n  * @param {*} val reference to test.\n  * @returns {boolean}\n  * @example\n  * ```js\n  *  isString('') // => true\n  *  isString(1) // => false\n  * ```\n  */\n  module.exports = function isString(val) {\n    return typeof val === 'string';\n  };\n  \n\n\n3. Commit the changes you have made to the component to your staging area.\nbit commit is-string \"added documentation\"\n4. Now the component is ready to be updated in the remote scope. export it.\nbit export @this/is-string @scopy\nYour changes will be published to the remote scope as a new version for the same component.\nVerify the version change with show command.\nbit show @scopy/is-string\n\nyou can read more about js-doc parsing Here\n\nSummary\n\nbit modify \nopen ./inline_components//impl.js // make some changes\nbit commit \nbit export @this \nUse a compiler\n1. Import the Babel environment to your local scope, and set it as default to all newly created components:\nbit import bit.envs/compilers/babel --compiler --save\n2. Modify bit modify @scopy/is-string.\n3. Add the compiler to the component's bit.json open inline_components/global/is-string/bit.json\n\nCopy and paste the following:\n\n{\n    \"sources\": {\n        \"impl\": \"impl.js\",\n        \"spec\": \"spec.js\"\n    },\n    \"env\": {\n        \"compiler\": \"bit.envs/compilers/babel::latest\",\n        \"tester\": \"none\"\n    },\n    \"dependencies\": {},\n    \"packageDependencies\": {}\n}\n2. Open the impl.js file: open inline_components/global/is-string/impl.js\n3. Make some changes in the impl.js file. you can also copy and paste the following code.\n\n  \n  /**\n  * determines whether `val` is a string.\n  * @param {*} val reference to test.\n  * @returns {boolean}\n  * @example\n  * ```js\n  *  isString('') // => true\n  *  isString(1) // => false\n  * ```\n  */\n  module.exports = val => typeof val === 'string';\n  \n\n\n\nyou can check the compiled file by using bit build -i is-string.\n\n4.

Import the Mocha environment to your local scope, and set it as default to all newly created components:\nbit import bit.envs/testers/mocha --tester --save\nA tester enables you to test your components, read more about it Here\n2. Modify bit modify @scopy/is-string.\n3. Create a spec.js in the component directory file using touch inline_components/global/is-string/spec.js.\n4. Open the spec.js file: open inline_components/global/is-string/spec.js\n5. Paste this implementation or write tests of your own:\nconst expect = require('chai').expect;\nconst isString = require(__impl__);\n\ndescribe('#isString()', () => {\n  it('should return true if `foo` is passed', () => {\n    expect(isString('foo')).to.equal(true);\n  });\n\n  it('should return false if `1` is passed', () => {\n    expect(isString(1)).to.equal(false);\n  });\n\n  it('should return false if `[]` is passed', () => {\n    expect(isString([1])).to.equal(false);\n  });\n});\n\n\nnote that the __impl__ is a reference to the impl file injected by the testing environment.\nyou can't use node modules like you would normal do, because the component should be exported to an isolated environment and run the specs there. you can only require the modules that the tester provides,\n\n6. Add the tester to the component's bit.json open ./inline_components/global/is-string/bit.json\n\nCopy and paste the following:\n\n    {\n        \"sources\": {\n            \"impl\": \"impl.js\",\n            \"spec\": \"spec.js\"\n        },\n        \"env\": {\n            \"compiler\": \"bit.envs/compilers/babel::latest\",\n            \"tester\": \"bit.envs/testers/mocha::latest\"\n        },\n        \"dependencies\": {},\n        \"packageDependencies\": {}\n    }\n7. Run the component's specs bit test --inline is-string.\n8. Commit the component bit commit is-string \"add unit tests\".\n9. Export to a remote scope bit export @this/is-string @scopy.\nSummary\n\nbit import  --tester --save\nbit modify /\ntouch inline_components//spec.js // create spec file\nopen inline_components//spec.js // add specs\nopen inline_components//bit.json // add tester\nbit test --inline \nbit commit  \"\"\nbit export @this/ \nFind a component\nYou can find components using the ‘search’ command.\n1. To search a component in your local scope, type:\n  bit search search_query -s @this\n\nNote that the search will only find components that have already been committed.\nFor example, create the bit 'is-string' in the scope ‘my_scope’.\n$ bit create is-string\nThen commit it:\n$ bit commit is-string \"initial commit\"\nThen search for it:\n$ bit search is-string -s @this\nOutput:\n\nglobal/is-string\n\n\n\n2. You can also search components on remote scopes (scopes that are located on a remote server). To do this, type:\nbit search search_query -s @scope_name\n  For example:\n$ bit search is-string -s @my_remote_scope\n  Output:\n> global/is-string\n3. A third option is to search for public components. All public components are hosted in www.bitsrc.io.\n  To search public components type:\nbit search search_query\n  For example:\nbit search is string\n  Output:\n> bit.utils/global/is-string\n  Read more about Bit search under Discoverability.\n"},"bit-component.html":{"url":"bit-component.html","title":"Bit Component","keywords":"","body":"Bit component\nWhat is a Bit component?\nA component is Bit's most fundamental entity. A code component is a testable and a reusable definition of a\ncertain atomic functionality that handles a single and a well-defiend responsibility.\nIt can be almost anything, from a function, class, object, array, string to a React or an AngularJS component.\nBit's component was designed with testability and simplicity in mind, our goal was to make it as simple as it\ngets to create, maintain, test and discover code components.\n\nCreation simplicity -\nCreating a component requires only one mandatory file which is the implementation file itself\n(tests and configuration are optional).\nTranspiling, testing, docs and other boilerplate mechanics can be set using the component environment.\nMaintainable -\nAutomatic versioning, a slim built-in Scope CI mechanism\nand a dependency management mechanism designed to center performance, consistency and predictability.\nDiscoverable -\nEach component is indexed and made fully discoverable by a natural-language search that aims to understand and cluster components by its functionality.\nSee our Scope Discoverability section for more information.\n\nComponent's Anatomy\nA Bit component's most fundamental and only mandatory file is the implementation file named impl.js (default name).\nThe implementation file consists the component implementation itself and its docs which are parsed to form\nthe entire component documentation (see Component Documentation section for more info).\nOn top of the implementation file, two more optional files can be added:\n\nspec.js -\ncontains the component's unit tests, designated to be executed by the configured Testing Environment.\nbit.json -\nConfiguration file for handling of dependencies, environment, naming conventions and more.\n\nPlease note, component file names can be configured via bit.json, spec.js and impl.js are the default names.\nComponent Example\nimpl.js -

Bit will uptick components version by one.\nNew component (component does not exists on scope) - A new component would be created.\n\nBit handles small code component with a single responsibility, not large packages. Such components simply tend to change less often. This made us favor strict versioning over SemVer and automatic updates. We value reliability and stability.\nComponent Documentation\nDocumentation for packages is not fun, but if you want your code to be truly reusable, other developers will need to have a place to learn how to use your code. We believe that the best place to tell people how to use your code, is... well.. alongside your code. This way, when you distribute code components, and even open a code component to review its code, the usage instruction are there (!).\nThis is no magic. To do this, bit utilize the 'Xdoc' format for annotating everything as a part of your code.\nLet's take JavaScript for example.\nJavaScript uses JSDocs to create documentation on JS code. Bit knows how to read these docs, and parse them in a way that gives other users a formatted view of them, to better understand what to expect from the component before even using it.\nHow does it work in real life?\nLet's imagine a pad-left function, and write the JSdocs:\n/**\n * pad a string to the left.\n * @name leftPad\n * @param {string} str string to pad\n * @param {number} len total\n * @param {string} ch char to use for padding\n * @returns {string} modified string\n * @example\n * ```js\n *  leftPad('foo', 5) // => \"  foo\"\n *  leftPad('foobar', 6) // => \"foobar\"\n *  leftPad(1, 2, '0') // => \"01\"\n *\n\n */\n\nWhen exporting the component to a scope, Bit will parse the annotations, and create a proper documentation from it. Furthermore, Bit will use the documentation to index the component, so when searching for components, a better documented code component will be more discoverable by other users.\n\nTo view the docs for a component you can either open the code, or use the `show` command (which also works on [remote scopes](bit-scope.md)).\n\n```sh\n› bit show string/pad-left\n┌────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│ Name               │ leftPad                                          │\n├────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│ Description        │ pad a string to the left.                        │\n├────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│ Args               │ (str: string, len: number, ch: string)           │\n├────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│ Returns            │ string -> modified string                        │\n└────────────────────┴──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\nExamples\n\n leftPad('foo', 5) // => \"  foo\"\n leftPad('foobar', 6) // => \"foobar\"\n leftPad(1, 2, '0') // => \"01\"\nComponent Debugging\nJavaScript\nSome IDEs (Integrated Development Environment) such as IntelliJ and Visual Studio Code have A built in debugger.\nIf you want to use the debugger on your bit components, in most cases you only need to put a breakpoint in the implementation file and the debugger will stop at the breakpoint.\nIn some cases you want to use a compiler, which creates a dist/dist.js file in your component root directory,\nin these cases, the dist/dist.js will be the file that runs.\nYou can attach a breakpoint in the dist/dist.js, and it will work, but debugging a compiled file is no fun. Therefore bit compilers will supply source maps and put them in the dist directory. Most IDEs have features to support source maps for debugging, let's take VScode for example.\nIf you attach a breakpoint on a file, VScode will try to identify the compiled version of it and bind the breakpoint in order to give the developer the experience of breakpoint in a pre compiled code (that's not actually runs by node).\nAll you need to do is to tell VScode where is the outFiles directory, and because the outFiles directory of bit is the components directory just add this to the launch.json file:\n\"outFiles\": [ \"${workspaceRoot}/components/**/*.js\" ]\nRead some more about VScode node-debugger handle source maps.\nComponent Environment\nMaking sure code can run everywhere is hard. To ease this process, Bit implements 'environments'.\nYou can define your code's build and test requirements. Bit will then make sure all requirements are met when using a components. Taking the load of building a boilerplate to run code from you, to Bit.\nAll environment are basically a code component that exports an API that allows Bit to either build or test a code component.\nBuild Environment\nSome programming languages need some sort of compiling done in order for them to run. If you use such language, Bit will make sure that the code you write will be able to build anywhere.\nDefine in bit.json the required build tool your code needs. Bit will use it to get all requirements so it can build it on any environment.\nThe build environment is a component with a set of requirements and an API for Bit to use.\nWhen you run bit build, Bit will download the build component and it's dependencies. Bit will use it to build your code within the scope. The outcome of this action will be a dist file that can run without any boilerplating.\nUsing Build Environment\nTo show how a build environment works, lets take this code, written in flow.\n/* @flow */\nmodule.exports = function isString(val: string): boolean {\n  return typeof val === 'string';\n};\n\nNow we can add the flow environment to the component's bit.json file.\n{\n    \"env\": {\n        \"compiler\": \"bit.envs/compilers/flow\"\n    }\n}\n\nand after running the bit build command, a dist.js file will be generated in component's folder:\n'use strict';\n\nmodule.exports = function isString(val) {\n  return typeof val === 'string';\n};\n\nTesting Environment\nThere are many libraries designated to run test cases for code. Each developer chooses the one right for him.\nLike build environments, Bit also support another type of environments for running tests.\nWhen running bit test, Bit imports the configured test environments with its dependencies. Using the imported environment, Bit runs the tests. Bit gets the output from the test results, and outputs it to you.\nTo run tests Bit uses a Bit component which provides an API to run the test suite with the specific test tool.\nNote - your specs should be written in the same build environment as your code.\nUsing Test Environment\nJust as build environment, a test environment is also defined in the component's bit.json file. However, to test a component you need to implement some tests for it.\nAdding tests to a component is very simple. Just create a file name spec in the component folder, implement, add the proper test environment to the bit.json file, and run using bit test \nFor example, lets implement tests for the isString code component from the previous example.\nAdd the following spec.js file:\nimport { expect } from 'chai';\n\nconst isString = require(__impl__);\n\ndescribe('#isString()', () => {\n  it('should return true if `foo` is passed', () => {\n    expect(isString('foo')).to.equal(true);\n  });\n});\n\nAnd the following test environment to bit.json\n{\n    \"env\": {\n        \"compiler\": \"bit.envs/compilers/flow\",\n        \"tester\": \"bit.envs/testers/mocha\"\n    }\n}\n\nNow run the tests using bit test , and see the results summary.\n› bit test -i is-string\ntests passed\ntotal duration - 4ms\n\n✔   #isString() should return true if `foo` is passed - 1ms\n\nWriting Environments\nBit does not contain build or test libraries. So you need to extend it to support your specific programming language and tooling. What you need to do is to implement a component designed to build or test using a specific library. Use a scope to host it, so you can reuse it later as a dependency for other components.\n"},"bit-scope.html":{"url":"bit-scope.html","title":"Bit Scope","keywords":"","body":"Bit Scope\nWhat is a Bit Scope?\nBit's Scope is one of the fundamental entities of Bit. A Scope is a dynamic codebase responsible to end-to-end management of code components.\nScopes are where components are stored, tested, built and integrate with each other.\nThe Scope's distributed nature is meant to enable teams to create scopes for every different level of abstraction inside the organization.\nFor example, a team in an organization may want\nEach component belongs in a scope (or multiple scopes). therefore, the scope's name appears in the component's ID path (which consists of owner/scope/box/component).\nDependency Management\nBit's dependency resolution and management was especially designed for the use code components.\nTherefore, we designed its dependency management mechanism with few major constraints in mind:\n\nInstallation (import) performance -\nTo make component installation fast, we're resolving depedencies on export. This design approach makes component installation to be based on bandwidth alone. \nPredictable and deterministic - \nThe same dependencies will be installed at the same exact version, anywhere and acoross every machine to avoid dependency hell and deep dependency debugging.\nComponent availability - \nComponents are cached to make sure specific versions or components you've used are always available in your \"closest scope\".\n\nWhen you build a new component, you can add as many dependencies as you need in the bit.json file.\nThe bit export command will ensure the component will be packaged with all its dependencies.\nWhen bit push is issued, the new component, with all its dependencies, will be all stored/cached on the scope.\nOnce a component is pushed to a scope, the receiving scope will try to build and test the component to ensure it is, in fact, isolated.\nbit import will download the component with all of its dependencies in a single call.\nThe benefits of on-export dependency resolution.\n\nFast build time - When your application builds Bit does nothing but simply downloading a flat list of dependencies. That's it. Bit doesn’t have a dependency tree, so no need for recalculating and downloading more dependencies. This means a faster build time. \nReliability - Since every component is stored with its dependencies, in a tested version to work with, you can be sure it will keep working in any new environment regardless of any changes made to its dependencies (even if deleted).\nNo duplications - Bit knows what are the exact dependencies it needs to grab, so if there are any duplications, it will simply download a single working copy. \n\nComponent Dependencies\nAs shows in the configurating bit section, you can list as many code components as dependencies to your own component. Also, the versions of the dependencies will be locked, until you decide to update them. This means that wherever the component is being used, it will have the same dependencies.\nPackage Dependencies\nJust as you can use other Bit components as dependencies, we also understand that there's a lot of previous work that have been developed and deployed to other package managers, and code components should be able to depend on them. Bit does it by integrating to other known package source (for example - NPM). However, bit does not handle these dependencies, and will not manage them. If a code component has a package dependency defined, it will tell the user what needs to be installed. So unlike code component dependencies, you will be required to manage your external dependencies by yourself. Bit will help you with letting you know what's missing, but will not interfere with your dependency resolution process. \nScope CI\nBit comes with a built-in slim CI mechanism.\nThe CI mechanism uses Bit's environment boilerplating to create an ad-hock CI process for each code component. This process happens while a component is being committed to the local scope, and exported to a remote scope. \nBy utilizing each component's build and test environments, Bit has the instructions for building and testing components. Also, if a component has a dependency (or even requires an external package from a known source - NPM for example), Bit will retrieve the dependencies when starting the process. This way Bit makes sure that each component is indeed isolated and encapsulated.\nThe reason Bit has this built-in CI engine, is that figuring out a proper CI process for packages is a hassle. It requires setting up a build server, figuring out the right scripts and maintaining everything alongside with your package itself. For large packages this makes sense, but when using micro-packages - this is a lot of work. On top of that - it's very hard to update and debug these processes, and even update, if the package itself changes the underline technology it uses (for example - changing the library used to run tests). Bit makes it to be a simple process, which is based of the fact that the environments it uses for build and test are actual code components (which Bit is designed to manage), with a specific API (to run and get results) and an internal dependency management for other components as well as external packages. All are parts of the ecosystem, which together form a CI engine for code components.\nBit forces strict rules when it get to building and testing code. If a component needs to be build to run (for example - transpile from TypeScript to ES), and the build process fails when exporting, Bit will fail the exporting process. The same thing happens if a component has a set of tests that failed to run. This is to make sure that no breaking changes are being exported (this behavior can be overridden by using the --force flag when exporting components).\nDiscoverability\nOne of the biggest problems for developers today is being able to find and reuse existing code components. Bit was created with exactly this problem in mind, so we place high importance on component discoverability.\nBit has an internal search engine capable of searching all the scopes connected to your computer. This search engine can be accessed from your CLI so you can access external resources without leaving your development environment. The search engine works by indexing components along with their documentation and querying them using fuzzy search techniques like abbreviations and stemming. This allows more flexibility when searching components, because you don’t have to remember exactly how you called your component in order to easily retrieve it. Our long-term aim is to introduce a semantic search that will allow developers to describe a component’s functionality in natural language and get the most relevant results regardless of the specific phrasing used when naming and documenting components. When we introduce semantic search, you’ll be able to use the query ‘is str’ for example, and get results where the name and documentation use different phrasings, like ‘validate string’ or ‘check string’. Another example would be 'convert string to int' which will return components like 'parse-int'.\nFinally, the paradigm of keeping your code components in small packages also facilitates discoverability. Normally, while writing and maintaining packages, you need to have a README file that explains the whole project to other developers. Maintaining it means more manual work, which in many cases ends up in out-of-date information. Keeping component documentation right with the code itself means that it will always be up-to-date, accessible and easy to use. Bit search also makes sure to provide you only with the most recent version of each component.\n"},"configuring-bit.html":{"url":"configuring-bit.html","title":"Configuring Bit","keywords":"","body":"Configuring Bit\nGeneral configuration\nThe general (global) configuration is configured through the bit config command.\nYou can learn more by typing bit config --help in the terminal.\n\n\n\nkey\nRequired\nType\nDetails\n\n\n\n\nssh_key_file\nF\nString\nA path to an ssh key file, defaults to \"~/.ssh/id_rsa\"\n\n\nuser.email\nT\nString\nThe Email of the user, will be saved on the commit logs\n\n\nuser.name\nT\nString\nThe name of the user, will be saved on the commit logs\n\n\nhub_domain\nF\nString\nThe domain of the default hub, defaults to \"hub.bitsrc.io\"\n\n\n\nYour Identity\nThe first thing you should do when you install Bit is to set your user name and e-mail address.

To do so, you will need to set up a remote server to do any collaboration on bit components (well, to be technically correct - you can import/export components directory from individual scopes, but it will not scale).\nThe best collaboration method is to set up a remote scope that all the consumers will have access to import and export component from. In this section, we'll refer to the 'remote scope' as 'bit server'. However, you will notice that the amount of resources used by a remote scope is so small, that you rarely need an entire server for it.\nTo set up a bit server you will need to decide on the type of protocol you need. Currently bit supports 2 protocols, which you will need to choose between them, according to your workflow. Then use this simple guide to run the commands required to create and connect the bit server.\nDue to the fact that a bit server in used only as a collaboration tool, a bit server is basically a bare repository. Meaning a bit scope with no working directory.\nProtocols\nBit currently supports 2 types of communication protocol, for the scopes to communicate with each other. Local and SSH.\nEach protocol has it's own use cases, and here you'll learn when to use which. \nLocal Protocol\nBit's local protocol is based on accessing folders and files in your local file system. This means that a bit server which uses the local protocol will not be accessible for users that want to connect to the bit server from outside of the machine. So using this protocol is best for local work only, such as evaluating bit or developing it.\nTo use it, simply connect to the bit server by using this command:\nbit remote add file://///\n\nSSH Protocol\nA common transport protocol for Bit when self-hosting is over SSH. This is because SSH access to servers is already set up in most places – and if it isn’t, it’s easy to do. SSH is also an authenticated network protocol; and because it’s ubiquitous, it’s generally easy to set up and use.\nThis makes SSH to be the preferred way for collaboration when developing components to remote scopes.\nTo add a bit server over SSH, run this command:\nbit remote add ssh://bit-server:////\n\nSetting up a server\nIn this section we'll explain how to use a remote server to setup as many scopes as needed.\nPrerequisites\n\n*nix server.\nUser for bit (with with .ssh and authorized_keys, for remote workflow).\n\nCreate a remote scope\nOnce you have all prerequisites, the one thing left is to run the bit init command with the --bare flag, to create a scope without a working directory.\nsu bit\nmkdir /opt/bit\ncd /opt/bit\nmkdir first-scope\ncd first-scope\nbit init --bare\n\nNow add your own public SSH key to the authorized_keys list of the user bit. This will allow you to import and export components hosted in first-scope.\nLet's add our first-scope as a remote scope to a newly create local scope on our development machine. I'll assume that our server is named bit-server, for the sake of this example.\nmkdir my-project\nbit init\nbit remote add ssh://bit-server:/opt/bit/first-scope\nbit create hello-world\nbit commit hello-world 'testing remote'\nbit export @this/hello-world first @first-scope\n\nNotice that when working with scopes, you need to prepand the scope's name with @. Also not that when working with your local scope, you can use @this to tell bit you are doing actions on it, and not on remote scopes.\nGenerating your SSH public key\nThese docs will describe the process of creating SSH key pair for Unix, seeing that it's a similar process across all operating systems.\n\nUse this command to generate a new SSH key pair\nssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C \"your_email@example.com\"\n\nView the content of ~/.ssh directory, and look for a pair of files named id_rsa and id_rsa.pub.\n\nCopy the content of the id_rsa.pub, and add it to your server's authorized_keys.\n\n\n"},"bit-internals.html":{"url":"bit-internals.html","title":"Bit Internals","keywords":"","body":"Bit internals\nBit Objects\n//TODO\nJSDoc parsing\nParsing the Docs yield useful information, such as the description of the component, its arguments, return type and usage examples.\nOther parts of the system, the Search, in particular, use that information for a better understanding what a component does.\nThe JSDoc get discovered by a Regex pattern, and parsing the docs is done by Doctrine.\n"},"glossary.html":{"url":"glossary.html","title":"Glossary","keywords":"","body":"Glossary\nThe glossary defines the various Bit entities and explains the relationship between them.\n\nComponent\nComponent id\nFull id\nInline id\n\n\nScope\nLocal Scope\nRemote Scope\n\n\nScope network\nBox (namespace)\ninline_components\ncomponents directory\nbit.json\nProject bit.json\nComponent bit.json\n\n\nEnvironment\nBuild environment\nCompiler\nTest environment\nTester\n\n\n\nComponent\nA code component is the smallest atomic functionality that handles a single responsibility.\nIt can be a anything, for example function, class, object, array, string etc ...\nSmall components can be composed together, creating a greater functionality.\nA Bit component consists of one file that includes the implementation: impl.js.\nIt can also contain two additional (recommended) files:\n\nspec.js - contains the component's unit tests.\n\nbit.json - contains dependencies, description, environments etc.\n\n\nComponent id\nThere are two types of ids.\nFull id\nConsists of //::, used in bit.json dependencies, compiler and tester fields.\nWhen you want to refer to a component located in a bit scope, you have to use the full id.\nInline id\nConsists of /.\nWhen you want to refer to a component located in the inline_components, you have to use the inline id.\nYou can also use the inline id to refer the components from your code. bit('array/sort')\nScope\nA scope is a collection of boxes and components.

It should be used as a \"staging area\" for the project's components.\n\nA local scope is automatically created for your project when you issue a bit init command. It can be found under the .bit directory.\n\nRemote scope\nThe best way to work with Bit and enjoy its full advantages is to work with a remote scope.\nComponents should be first committed to your local project's scope, then exported to a remote scope.\n\nA remote scope is just a regular scope created on a remote machine.\n\nBy doing so, you enable multiple team members to be connected to the same scopes making it easy to reuse components and collaborate. You can connect a remote scope to other remote scopes, creating an interconnected scopes network.\n\nYou can create a remote scope with the bit init --bare command in an empty directory. Bit will take the directory name as the scope name as a default behavior.\n\nUse a bit remote add command to manually set up your own remote scope on a local machine.\nFor more information on how to set a remote scope learn more here.\nScope network\nScopes can be interconnected between themselves to form a network.\nBy implementing a network, scopes can share components as dependencies.\nYou can read more about this topic at the Network of Bit scopes section.\nBox (namespace)\nBoxes are actually just namespaces. They can help organize your components.\nif you don't specify a box, the component will be created at the global box.\nExample: bit create array\\sort # create the component 'sort' in the 'array' box.\nExample: bit create do-work # create the component 'do-work' in the 'global' box.\nTo use components within boxes, you can append the box name to the component's ID when calling it.\nExample: bit('array\\sort');\nExample: bit('do-work');\ninline_components\nThe inline_components directory is a workspace for creating new components.\nCreating or modifying a component can be done directly from your inline_components directory, without having to create a new project or switching contexts. This is a key concept in Bit's workflow.\nyou can create a component yourself, or use bit create \nOnce you are done writing (or modifying) a component, you can commit the changes using the bit commit  command. This command packages your component and runs the Bit CI cycle to test and build the component. The final result is extracted from your inline folder to the project’s local scope.\nImportant notes:\n\nIt is considered best practice try and keep the inline_components empty. You should only have components in there if you are currently working on them.\n\nThis folder should be a part of your project, so it can't be in the .gitignore file (for example).\n\nThe drivers that implement the resolution algorithm will check the inline_components before going to the components directory.\n\n\ncomponents directory\nThe components directory is managed by Bit.

This commands adds the component as a dependency to your code via an entry in bit.json file.\nA component can be defined as a 'tester' or a 'compiler', to be used as an environment.\nYou can also choose to simply download component to the current folder, and not to the scope, to be viewed/tested without adding to your bit.json file.\nThere's no need to set compiler or tester components as dependencies for your scope. Bit imports components that are runnable, so no need to test or build them in order to use them.\nOptions\n-s, --save\n    Imports component to current folder, no need for scope.\n\n-t, --tester\n    Imports the component as a 'testing environment', so Bit will be able to use it to run the tests for components.\n\n-c, --compiler\n    Imports component as a 'building environment', so Bit will be able to use it to compile the component to a runable code.\nExamples\nImport a component, and set it as a dependency for the current scope.\nbit import \nImport a component, without saving it as a dependency.\nbit import  -s\nImport a component as a build environment, and not set it as a dependency for the project.\nbit import  -c\n\nInit\nName\nbit-init - Initiate an empty scope.\nSynopsis\nbit init [path] [--bare[=] | -b] [--shared[=] | -s]\nDescription\nThis command creates an empty Bit scope - basically a bit.json file, and a .bit directory with subdirectories for objects, environment and temporary files.\nRunning ‘bit init’ in an existing scope is safe. It will not overwrite components that are already there but only reinitialize corrupted system files if possible.\nOptions\n-b, --bare # initialize an empty bit bare scope\n\n--shared # add group write permissions to a repository properly\nExamples\nCreates an empty Bit scope in current working directory.\nbit init\nCreates an empty Bit scope in /tmp folder.\nbit init /tmp\nCreates a bare scope named ‘my-scope’.\nbit init --bare my-scope\nSpecify that the Bit scope is to be shared by several users in the same group by setting file group permissions properly.

Once you have the component in your local scope (@this), you can use this command to prepare it for modification.\nWhen the component is being 'modified', it's in the inline_components folder, which means you can now do any modification to it. To save modifications, issue the 'commit' command.\nExamples\nModify a component that is in your local scope.\nbit modify @this/\nMofidy a remote component.\nbit modify \n\nRemote\nName\nremote-cmd - Manages your list of remote scopes.\nSynopsis\n`bit remote [add=\"remote scope\"] [rm=\"remote name\"] [--global | -g]\nDescription\nBit allows you to connect to remote scopes to allow importing and exporting components. This allows collaboration on code components, share them across teams, and reuse across projects.\nThe 'remote' command manages the list of remote scopes connected to current remote.\nWhen working with many remotes, and some dependencies are shared between remote scopes, you must connect these scoepes between themselves. This will allow components to have dependencies from other scopes.\nOptions\n-g, --global\n    Manage globally configured remotes\nExamples\nAdd a remote scope to local scope.\nbit remote add \nList all remote scopes configured to locaol scope.\nbit remote\nRemove a remote scope\nbit remote rm \n\nSearch\nName\nsearch-cmd - Search a component in a scope.\nSynopsis\nbit search search_query -s @scope_name\nDescription\nSearch in either local or remote scope for a component. The search covers the name, description and docs of each component.\nEach scope has its own index of components. \nIf you search in the current scope, use bit search search_query -s @this.\nTo search in another scope, use bit search search_query -s @scope_name\nTo search public components on [bitsrc.io] (www.bitsrc.io), use bit search search_query\nExamples\nSearch for a component in a current scope.\nbit search concat array -s @this\nSearch for a component in a remote scope.\nbit search concat array -s @my_remote_scope\nSearch for a public component on [bitsrc.io] (www.bitsrc.io).\nbit search concat array\n\nShow\nName\nshow-cmd - Show metadata of a given component.\nSynopsis\nbit show [--inline | -i] [component ID]\nDescription\nShows name, description, environment, docs, version, date.... of a component.\nOptions\n-i, --inline\n    Shows data of component in inline_components folder\nExamples\nPrint data of local component.\nbit show @this/\nPrint data of a remote component.\nbit show \nprint data of a component in inline_components.\nbit show -i \n\nStatus\nName\nBit-status - Show status of components in modification.\nSynopsis\nbit status\nDescription\nDisplays list of all components in current workspace.

You can write components in any language you'd like, and Bit will be able to manage them. To facilitate this behavior Bit requires a driver for each programming language, so that the components will be accessible to used in your code.\nWhat does the driver do?\nThe driver resolves the ID of the components you want to use in your code, and using dependency injection run the component you want to use.\nImportant To import and manage components use Bit-CLI. This doc only explains how to use components in your code.\nIn this docs we will describe all currently available drivers.\nJavaScript\nBit's first fully supported programming language is JavaScript.\nYou can find the bit-js driver codebase here.\nInstalling bit-js\nBit Node driver is distributed as any other JavaScript package - using NPM.\nTo install bit-js package, run:\nnpm install bit-js -s\n\nThis will add the bit-node package as a dependency.\nDrivers\nUsing JavaScript Components\nTo use Bit components within your JS code you need to first require bit-node:\nconst bit = require('bit-js');\n\nNow it's a matter of calling the right components, like so:\nisString = bit('is-string');\nconsole.log(isString('Hello World');\n\nThat's it :)\nRuntime Dependency Resolution\n// TODO\n"},"bitsource.html":{"url":"bitsource.html","title":"BitSource","keywords":"","body":"BitSource\n// TODO\n"},"GLOSSARY.html":{"url":"GLOSSARY.html","keywords":"","body":"Glossary\nThe glossary defines the various Bit entities and explains the relationship between them.\n\nComponent\nComponent id\nFull id\nInline id\n\n\nScope\nLocal Scope\nRemote Scope\n\n\nScope network\nBox (namespace)\ninline_components\ncomponents directory\nbit.json\nProject bit.json\nComponent bit.json\n\n\nEnvironment\nBuild environment\nCompiler\nTest environment\nTester\n\n\n\nComponent\nA code component is the smallest atomic functionality that handles a single responsibility.\nIt can be a anything, for example function, class, object, array, string etc ...\nSmall components can be composed together, creating a greater functionality.\nA Bit component consists of one file that includes the implementation: impl.js.\nIt can also contain two additional (recommended) files:\n\nspec.js - contains the component's unit tests.\n\nbit.json - contains dependencies, description, environments etc.\n\n\nComponent id\nThere are two types of ids.\nFull id\nConsists of //::, used in bit.json dependencies, compiler and tester fields.\nWhen you want to refer to a component located in a bit scope, you have to use the full id.\nInline id\nConsists of /.\nWhen you want to refer to a component located in the inline_components, you have to use the inline id.\nYou can also use the inline id to refer the components from your code. bit('array/sort')\nScope\nA scope is a collection of boxes and components. The most basic role of the scope is to group and organize components. The scope's name appears in the component's id.\nScopes are where components are stored, built and tested.\nThere are two kinds of scopes: Local and Remote.\nThe local and Remote scopes are technically identical.\nHowever, they serve different purposes.\nLocal scope\nEach project has a unique local scope. It should be used as a \"staging area\" for the project's components.\n\nA local scope is automatically created for your project when you issue a bit init command. It can be found under the .bit directory.\n\nRemote scope\nThe best way to work with Bit and enjoy its full advantages is to work with a remote scope.\nComponents should be first committed to your local project's scope, then exported to a remote scope.\n\nA remote scope is just a regular scope created on a remote machine.\n\nBy doing so, you enable multiple team members to be connected to the same scopes making it easy to reuse components and collaborate. You can connect a remote scope to other remote scopes, creating an interconnected scopes network.\n\nYou can create a remote scope with the bit init --bare command in an empty directory. Bit will take the directory name as the scope name as a default behavior.\n\nUse a bit remote add command to manually set up your own remote scope on a local machine.\nFor more information on how to set a remote scope learn more here.\nScope network\nScopes can be interconnected between themselves to form a network.\nBy implementing a network, scopes can share components as dependencies.\nYou can read more about this topic at the Network of Bit scopes section.\nBox (namespace)\nBoxes are actually just namespaces. They can help organize your components.\nif you don't specify a box, the component will be created at the global box.\nExample: bit create array\\sort # create the component 'sort' in the 'array' box.\nExample: bit create do-work # create the component 'do-work' in the 'global' box.\nTo use components within boxes, you can append the box name to the component's ID when calling it.\nExample: bit('array\\sort');\nExample: bit('do-work');\ninline_components\nThe inline_components directory is a workspace for creating new components.\nCreating or modifying a component can be done directly from your inline_components directory, without having to create a new project or switching contexts. This is a key concept in Bit's workflow.\nyou can create a component yourself, or use bit create \nOnce you are done writing (or modifying) a component, you can commit the changes using the bit commit  command. This command packages your component and runs the Bit CI cycle to test and build the component. The final result is extracted from your inline folder to the project’s local scope.\nImportant notes:\n\nIt is considered best practice try and keep the inline_components empty. You should only have components in there if you are currently working on them.\n\nThis folder should be a part of your project, so it can't be in the .gitignore file (for example).\n\nThe drivers that implement the resolution algorithm will check the inline_components before going to the components directory.\n\n\ncomponents directory\nThe components directory is managed by Bit. All the imported components will be there.\nbit.json\nThe bit.json file is used as a configuration file for project and component levels.\nproject bit.json\nUsed for defining project dependencies (bit components), that will be imported in the bit import command.\nAlso, used as a prototype for defining default properties for the components in the inline_directory.\n\nfor example, if a component does not have a bit.json file, it inherits all properties (besides dependencies) from the project's bit.json.\n\ncomponent bit.json\nUsed for defining the component's dependencies, package dependencies, compiler, tester, and the names of impl. and spec. files.\nEnvironment\nBit consists of two main environments build (compile) and test.\nBuild environment\nSome programming languages need some sort of compiling/transpiling in order for them to run. If you use such language, Bit will make sure that the code you write will be able to compile anywhere.\nCompiler\nThe required compiler your code needs is defined in bit.json { env: { compiler: compiler_id }}.\nThe build environment is just a Bit component with a simple interface. It must have a compile method, which is a sync method that accepts raw source code (string) and returns compiled code (string).\nTest environment\nThere are many designated libraries to run unit tests for code. Each developer chooses the one her/she needs.\nTester\nthe tester, like the compiler, it's just a Bit component implementing the tester interface. It is defined in bit.json under { env: { tester: tester_id }}.\n// TODO - write about the tester interface\n"}}}
